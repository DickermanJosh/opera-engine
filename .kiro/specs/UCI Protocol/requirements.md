# UCI Protocol Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol in the Opera Engine. The UCI protocol is the standard communication protocol used by chess engines to interact with chess GUI applications, tournament management systems, and analysis tools.

**Architecture Overview**: The UCI implementation will be a Rust-based coordination layer that serves as an intelligent bridge between the C++ engine core, Python AI wrapper, and external chess applications. It will handle async protocol parsing, command routing, FFI coordination, and robust error handling while maintaining the engine's Paul Morphy-inspired playing style.

## 2. User Stories

### Engine Users
- **As an engine user**, I want consistent UCI behavior across different platforms, so that my tools work reliably
- **As an engine user**, I want fast engine startup and response times, so that I can analyze positions efficiently
